                in
                the summer of 2022. This project was to increase the involvement of college students in the
                Quad
                Cities community. Many people in
                the QC are engaged in a variety of fascinating and exciting activities, including taking on
                projects, starting new eateries, growing their businesses, and much more. Many college
                students
                weren't involved in the quad city community so this project was designed to increase the
                awareness.

                purpose of this frat was to build bonds and form brotherhood on and after campus. I joined this frat
                because the members
                of this frat are goal-oriented and many of the members pursue majors related to technology which is
                same as mine.
