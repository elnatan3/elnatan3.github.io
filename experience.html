            <p>➡ I had an internship at Web Guild at the Edge center in Augustana College in summer 2022. I was a
                web developer and I developed many websites for clients. In this experience, not only did I get
                the opportunity to develop and update real companys' website but I also engaged with clients and
                formed
                relationships. I got the chance to visit different small businesses as part of cool qc project
                and interview different owners of those businesses. I got to learn a lot about how businesses
                operate. At the internship, there were other interns whose positions were different than mine
                including designers, social media marketers, video editors, photographers, and more. I got to
                learn how projects are managed and essentially developed my overall skills. At this internship,
                I mainly: <br><br>
                ➤ Created various website layouts in accordance with a client's description<br>
                ➤ Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript extensively to build and manage websites using the layout
                that clients' preferred while also honing my programming abilities.<br>
                ➤ Used different software such as Visual Studio Code, Adobe Photoshop, Git Hub, and other
                customized software to develop websites.</p>

            <p>➡ I worked as Community advisor or residential director at Augustana College. Through this
                experience, I learned a lot about leadership, building a community, time management, responsibility and accountability. I also learned how to treat different kinds of people, how to communicate, and overall challenged me
                to
                be a more reliable and independant individual. In this position, I mainly:<br><br>
                ➤ Worked as a supervisor and counselor to residents while implementing campus policies.<br>
                ➤ Applied leadership and organizational skills to plan events and execute them to educate
                residents about important issues and to facilitate a stronger community of diverse
                residents.<br>
                ➤ Developed professional and communication skills to resolve conflicts and handle any
                situation
                appropriately.</p>

            <p>➡ I worked at the Gerber Center Dining at Augustana College during my second semester of college. During
                this time, the covid pandemic was still going on so I had a lot of responsibilities. I was repsonsible for making sure everything was handled carefully and communicated with students about what they want to eat.  
                I had to opportunity to learn how to cook, how to properly clean utensils,
                windows, counters, and more. It was a fast paced job, as the demand for food was high during peak hours so I learn how to
                effectively take action rapidly when serving students. I developed friendships with many college students and it was a great experience. </p>
