                <p>➡ I had an internship at Web Guild at the Edge center in Augustana College in summer 2022. I was a
                    web developer and I developed many websites for clients. In this experience, not only did I get
                    the opportunity to develop and update real companys' website but I also engaged with clients and
                    formed
                    relationships. I got the chance to visit different small businesses as part of cool qc project
                    and interview different owners of those businesses. I got to learn a lot about how businesses
                    operate. At the internship, there were other interns whose positions were different than mine
                    including designers, social media marketers, video editors, photographers, and more. I got to
                    learn how projects are managed and essentially developed my overall skills. At this internship,
                    I mainly: <br><br>
                    ➤ Created various website layouts in accordance with a client's description<br>
                    ➤ Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript extensively to build and manage websites using the layout
                    that clients' preferred while also honing my programming abilities.<br>
                    ➤ Used different software such as Visual Studio Code, Adobe Photoshop, Git Hub, and other
                    customized software to develop websites.</p>

                <p>➡ I worked as Community advisor or residential director at Augustana College. Through this
                    experience, I learned a lot about leadership, building a community, time management, responsibility
                    and accountability. I also learned how to treat different kinds of people, how to communicate, and
                    overall challenged me
                    to
                    be a more reliable and independant individual. In this position, I mainly:<br><br>
                    ➤ Worked as a supervisor and counselor to residents while implementing campus policies.<br>
                    ➤ Applied leadership and organizational skills to plan events and execute them to educate
                    residents about important issues and to facilitate a stronger community of diverse
                    residents.<br>
                    ➤ Developed professional and communication skills to resolve conflicts and handle any
                    situation
                    appropriately.</p>

                    service with every visit. I meticulously prepared menu items following brand standards, operated the
                    Point of Sale system with accuracy, and maintained a clean, welcoming environment. Collaborating
                    with my team, I thrived in our fast-paced setting, always prioritizing customer satisfaction and
                    food quality. </p>

                <p>➡ I worked at the Gerber Center Dining at Augustana College during my second semester of college.
                    During
                    this time, the covid pandemic was still going on so I had a lot of responsibilities. I was
                    repsonsible for making sure everything was handled carefully and communicated with students about
                    what they want to eat.
                    I had to opportunity to learn how to cook, how to properly clean utensils,
                    windows, counters, and more. It was a fast paced job, as the demand for food was high during peak
                    hours so I learn how to
                    effectively take action rapidly when serving students. I developed friendships with many college
                    students and it was a great experience. </p>
