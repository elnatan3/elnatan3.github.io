                    <h2> Memory Puzzle Game (Python)</h2>
                    <img src="img/pyth.png">
                    <p>I created a memory puzzle game using the python language. It is user-friendly and any person with
                        little to no
                        experience can play this game. It makes use of algorithms that tracks where card with
                        a specific label, color, and shape is. It randomly chooses different cards and draws it on the
                        grid. Then it
                        asks the user the color and shape of the label after displaying it for few
                        seconds. Then it compares the attributes of the card and calls different functions. It has
                        different levels
                        with different difficulties. The goal is to help people focus and tests your memory and brain
                        power. I provided a
                        documentation that includes a description of how to play the game, any challenges users might
                        face and any
                        limitations to this game.</p>

                    <h2> Ethiopian Recipe App (Java)</h2>
                    <img src="img/ethiopianRecipeApp.png">
                    <p>I created an Ethiopia Recipe App that allows users from around
                        the world to learn about Ethiopian dishes. The inspiration behind developing
                        this app was becasue I wanted to spread the word of the food I use to eat back
                        home on the daily basis. The different kind of food is so delicious and I want
                        people to not only now the name of these dishes but also how they are made because most
                        of these foods are made using ingridients that people use in the western world. The app is
                        secure
                        as it asks for login credentials that I have provided in the Read Me on my github respository.
                        Also
                        it allows users to add, edit, and delete recipes. Also, I provided additional advanced features
                        on my app
                        such as the ability to add food to your favorite list, the ability to search for foods, and
                        more. I designed the
                        app as the basis for the platform for Ethiopians all around the world to contribute to it and
                        share the delicious foods of
                        Ethiopia.

                    <p>I created a student database that makes use of tables, queries, forms, and reports. It is an
                        automated
                        system that allows teachers to login with their details, and access student information. It uses
                        relational
                        database to make changes to different forms at once. By entering
                        student grades, the system automatically calculates different details of grades and displays the
                        total, average, minimum, maximum
                        scores. It also allows teachers to easily find and search students just by typing specific
                        details. It also
                        generates the final reports from different forms. Finally, it allows teachers to take attendance
                        efficiently
                        and
                        easily
                        track the overall attendance report of students.</p>

                        use of applying encapsulation, polymorphism, & inheritance concepts. I implemented use of agile

                    <h2> Ethiopian Proverb Quiz (Java and Swing)</h2>
                    <img src="img/proverb.png">
                    <p>The Ethiopian Proverb Quiz is an educational app that allows users to test their knowledge of
                        traditional Ethiopian proverbs.
                        As an Ethiopian, I grew up hearing these proverbs from my family, and I am inspired to share
                        them with the world.
                        The app includes eight common Ethiopian proverbs and their associated multiple-choice questions.
                        The user must choose the correct answer from four possible choices.
                        The questions cover a wide range of topics, such as gender, humility, and the value of
                        knowledge.
                        To begin the quiz, the user is welcomed to the app and prompted to enter their name.
                        The app then displays the first question and presents four answer choices.
                        The user must select the correct answer within 10 seconds. If the user chooses the correct
                        answer, they earn a point, and the app moves on to the next question.
                        At the end of the quiz, the user receives their score as a percentage of the number of correct
                        answers.
                        The app also displays the total number of questions and the number of questions answered
                        correctly.
                        The app interface features a text field for displaying the questions, a text area for displaying
                        the user's name and score, and four buttons for selecting the answer choices.
                        The app also includes a countdown timer that displays the remaining time for each question.
                        Overall, the Ethiopian Proverb Quiz is an excellent tool for anyone interested in learning about
                        Ethiopian culture and traditions.</p>

                    <h2> English to Amharic Language assessment (Python and PyQt5)</h2>
                    <img src="img/language.png">
                    <p>The Amharic Language Learning App is a software application designed to help people learn basic
                        day-to-day words in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia.
                        Amharic is the only language in Ethiopia, and yet it is not widely known or recognized outside
                        of the country.
                        This app aims to promote and spread awareness of this beautiful language to the world. The app
                        features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5, a popular Python library for
                        developing desktop applications.
                        The GUI consists of a main window with several widgets, including a question label, an answer
                        field, a submit button, a feedback label, a progress bar, a correct answer label, and an image
                        label.
                        The app presents six questions, each asking for the Amharic translation of a basic English word
                        or phrase, such as "hello", "bye", "thank you", and "yes".
                        The app provides the correct answers for each question, along with an image depicting the word
                        or phrase in Amharic script.
                        The user enters their answer into the answer field and clicks the submit button to check their
                        answer.
                        The progress bar updates after each question.
                        If the user's answer is correct, the app displays a green "Correct!" message.
                        If the user's answer is incorrect, the app displays a red "Incorrect." message and provides the
                        correct answer along with an image label.
                        The app continues to present questions until all six questions have been answered, at which
                        point the app displays a score message with the number of correct answers and a percentage
                        score.
                        Overall, the Amharic Language Learning App is a simple yet effective tool for introducing users
                        to the basics of Amharic, and for promoting the beauty and richness of this unique language.<br>

                    <p>I worked on a python research project with a faculty member. This project started in 2016, was
                        updated in 2019 but was not continued and had few bugs. I joined the team in 2022.
                        The purpose of this project was to find out people's preference in walking or biking in
                        the Rock Island area, how physically active people were, and to encourage people to walk/bike.
                        The python file outputs all the details regarding which areas people enjoyed walking/biking
                        frequently vs areas people avoid based on the different calculations such as the mode and other
                        criterias.
                        Such criterias include the specific reasons people do certain things. For example, people
                        walking/biking to get things done/going for a walk/would consider walking/biking in the area.
                        Within each criteria we would also consider walking only in the side walks and walking in
                        streets and side walks.
                        We would map the route on google earth during the hand conversations and the python file uses an
                        algorithym to generate the street blocks and colors for the routes based on the rating for that
                        specific block. The python would also
                        generate a conversations folder and compilations folder to distinguish the different criterias.

                    <p>I wrote this research paper with a faculty member in the computer
                        science department in my school. The paper was about exploring the
                        capabilities of UAVs in different industries. We studied the risks and evaluated
                        the security concerns of these UAVs and found surprising results. We also ended the paper
                        recommending the next moves for these UAVs and suggested ideas for further research. Our paper
                        was published by
                        accepted and recommended for publication in Springer by the ICISS 2023. It was then accepted for
                        virtual
                        presentation. I will provide the link of the presentation that I gave down in the link below:

                    <h2> Research Paper on Prevention and Detection of Network Attacks: A
                        Comprehensive Study

                    <img src="img/research_paper_2.png">
                    <p>I wrote this research paper with a group of my computer science peers in my school. The paper was
                        about studying
                        the prevention and detection of Network Attacks. It focused on cyber attacks such as DDos
                        Attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, injection attack, brute Force Attack, and more.
                        We also studied further how AI is used to create cyber attacks and how AI is used in cyber
                        attack defense. Finally, we explored the consequences and presented our results. We found IRP
                        preventions and
                        Machine learning methods to detect cyber attacks. We realized that for different type of cyber
                        attack, a different detection mechanism can more effective than the other. Our full paper that
                        was submitted to ICDSST 2023 was
                        accepted for publication in the Springer book series of LNBIP. </p>
