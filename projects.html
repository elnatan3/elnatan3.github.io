        <h2> Memory Puzzle Game (python)</h2>
        <img src="img/pyth.png">
        <p>I created a memory puzzle game using the python language. It is user-friendly and any person with little to no
            experience can play this game. It makes use of algorithms that tracks where card with
            a specific label, color, and shape is. It randomly chooses different cards and draws it on the grid. Then it
            asks the user the color and shape of the label after displaying it for few
            seconds. Then it compares the attributes of the card and calls different functions. It has different levels
            with different difficulties. The goal is to help people focus and tests your memory and brain power. I provided a
            documentation that includes a description of how to play the game, any challenges users might face and any
            limitations to this game.</p>
        <p>Here is a link to the files of the memory puzzle game:<br>

        <h2> Student Database (Microsoft Access and relational database)</h2>
        <img src="img/student.png">
        <p>I created a student database that makes use of tables, queries, forms, and reports. It is an automated
            system that allows teachers to login with their details, and access student information. It uses relational
            database to make changes to different forms at once. By entering
            student grades, the system automatically calculates different details of grades and displays the total, average, minimum, maximum
            scores. It also allows teachers to easily find and search students just by typing specific details. It also
            generates the final reports from different forms. Finally, it allows teachers to take attendance efficiently
            and
            easily
            track the overall attendance report of students.</p>

        <h2> Three D Game Board (Java and Software Development)</h2>
        <img src="img/ThreeDBoardProject.png">
        <p>I was part of a group project in my CSC 305 Software Development course, where I developed a Three Game Board using Java and Java FX. I used external or third party code libraries
            for create creating the stage and scene for the project. I used event-based programming and GUI design, exception handling, and threading. The projects makes
            use of applying encapsulation, polymorphism, & inheritance. During this project, we made use of agile methodologies for doing the project and divided the tasks
            between each other. We used github for team collaboration.</p>

        <h2> Undependant Rock Island Research Project (Python, Google Earth, Microsoft Excel)</h2>
        <img src="img/pythonresearch.png">
        <p>This is a python research project I worked with a faculty member. The project started in 2019 but since covid hit it was on a pauce until 2022 where I joined to help out to continue/debug/finish the project. 
            The purpose of this project was to find out people's preference in walking or biking in
            the Rock Island area, how physically active people are, and to output all the details regarding which areas people enjoy walking/Biking frequently vs people avoid based on the mode and other criterias taken
            into account. Such criterias include, people walking/biking to get things done/going for a walk/would consider the area. Within each criteria we would consider, walking only in the side walks and walking in streets and side walks. 
            We would map the route on google earth during the hand conversations and the python would generate the street blocks and colors for the routes based on the rating for that specific block. The python would also
            generate a conversations folder and compilations folder to distinguish the different criterias.
