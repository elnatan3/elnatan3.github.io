                        <img src="img/pyth.png">
                        <p>I created a memory puzzle game using the python language. It is user-friendly and any person with little to no
                            experience can play this game. It makes use of algorithms that tracks where card with
                            a specific label, color, and shape is. It randomly chooses different cards and draws it on the grid. Then it
                            asks the user the color and shape of the label after displaying it for few
                            seconds. Then it compares the attributes of the card and calls different functions. It has different levels
                            with different difficulties. The goal is to help people focus and tests your memory and brain power. I provided a
                            documentation that includes a description of how to play the game, any challenges users might face and any
                            limitations to this game.</p>

                        <h2> Ethiopian Recipe App (Java)</h2>
                        <img src="img/ethiopianRecipeApp.png">
                        <p>I created an Ethiopia Recipe App that allows users from around
                            the world to learn about Ethiopian dishes. The inspiration behind developing 
                            this app was becasue I wanted to spread the word of the food I use to eat back
                            home on the daily basis. The different kind of food is so delicious and I want
                            people to not only now the name of these dishes but also how they are made because most
                            of these foods are made using ingridients that people use in the western world. The app is secure
                            as it asks for login credentials that I have provided in the Read Me on my github respository. Also 
                            it allows users to add, edit, and delete recipes. Also, I provided additional advanced features on my app
                            such as the ability to add resumes to your favorite list, the ability to search for recipes, and more. I designed the 
                            app as the basis for the platform for Ethiopian all around the world to contribute to it and share the delicious foods of 
                            Ethiopia.

                        <img src="img/student.png">
                        <p>I created a student database that makes use of tables, queries, forms, and reports. It is an automated
                            system that allows teachers to login with their details, and access student information. It uses relational
                            database to make changes to different forms at once. By entering
                            student grades, the system automatically calculates different details of grades and displays the total, average, minimum, maximum
                            scores. It also allows teachers to easily find and search students just by typing specific details. It also
                            generates the final reports from different forms. Finally, it allows teachers to take attendance efficiently
                            and
                            easily
                            track the overall attendance report of students.</p>

                        <p>In my CSC 305 Software Development course, I developed a Three Game Board using Java FX. I used external or third party code libraries
                            for creating the stage and scene for the project. I used event-based programming and GUI design, exception handling, and threading. The projects makes
                            use of applying encapsulation, polymorphism, & inheritance concepts. I implemented use of agile methodologies for doing the project with my team and springs and milestones for divided the tasks
                            between each other. We used github for team collaboration.</p>

                        <img src="img/pythonresearch.png">
                        <p>I worked on a python research project with a faculty member. This project started in 2016, was updated in 2019 but was not continued and had few bugs. I joined the team in 2022.
                            The purpose of this project was to find out people's preference in walking or biking in
                            the Rock Island area, how physically active people were, and to encourage people to walk/bike. The python file outputs all the details regarding which areas people enjoyed walking/biking frequently vs areas people avoid based on the different calculations such as the mode and other criterias. 
                            Such criterias include the specific reasons people do certain things. For example, people walking/biking to get things done/going for a walk/would consider walking/biking in the area. Within each criteria we would also consider walking only in the side walks and walking in streets and side walks. 
                            We would map the route on google earth during the hand conversations and the python file uses an algorithym to generate the street blocks and colors for the routes based on the rating for that specific block. The python would also
                            generate a conversations folder and compilations folder to distinguish the different criterias.
