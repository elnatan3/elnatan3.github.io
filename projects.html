                        <p id="musipedia" style="display: none; margin-top: -70px;">I created Musipedia, a comprehensive
                            and user-friendly music library website. Musipedia
                            serves as a centralized hub for storing and managing a vast collection of information
                            related to songs, artists, albums, genres, and playlists. My primary goal was to design an
                            interface that provides intuitive search, filtering, and sorting functionalities, allowing
                            users to easily navigate and explore the extensive music catalog.

                            To ensure efficiency and simplicity, Musipedia employs standardized metadata within its
                            music database. This standardization enables users to search and filter content based on
                            various criteria, facilitating a seamless browsing experience. Moreover, Musipedia
                            incorporates robust security measures to safeguard user information. Registered users can
                            create accounts and securely store their personal data, including playlists tailored to
                            their preferences.


                            The website encompasses diverse features to enhance user engagement. On the homepage, users
                            can discover their desired rhythm by exploring a wide range of beats. They have the
                            opportunity to interact with the beats by playing and downloading them. Additionally, a
                            contact form located at the bottom of the homepage allows users to conveniently reach out to
                            us, with messages promptly forwarded to my email.

                            Musipedia's artist and album sections offer users the ability to explore different artists
                            and albums, each containing a curated selection of songs. Users can utilize the search
                            functionality, filtering their results based on the characters they enter. The songs section
                            provides detailed information about each song, including the playlist it belongs to and the
                            date it was added. Users can add songs to new playlists or mark them as favorites,
                            automatically including them in their personalized favorite playlist.

                            Furthermore, Musipedia includes a dedicated playlist section where users can access and
                            manage their playlists. This section provides insights into the total number of songs and
                            the overall duration of each playlist, dynamically updating as users make changes. Users can
                            edit their playlists and conveniently share them via Gmail and iMessages.

                            Lastly, Musipedia features a genre section, enabling users to explore different music
                            genres. Within this section, users can search through genres and discover the songs
                            associated with each genre, further expanding their musical horizons.

                            By providing a comprehensive music library, user-friendly interface, robust security
                            measures, and a range of engaging features, Musipedia aims to deliver an immersive and
                            enjoyable experience for music enthusiasts.

                            terrain creator that was developed using Java and JavaFX,
                            with the aid of external libraries for creating the stage and scene. This project allows you
                            to chose existing templates or customize your own design on a game board with the ability to
                            select/deselect tiles, change the elevation of tiles, edit your board seamlessly, and
                            utilize different features as well as making tiles pointy. The project showcases a range of
                            programming techniques, including event-driven programming, GUI design, exception handling,
                            and threading, as well as the application of advanced concepts such as encapsulation,
                            polymorphism, and inheritance.

                            Throughout the development process, an agile methodology was employed to ensure effective
                            team collaboration and task management. This involved using sprints and milestones to divide
                            the work between team members, as well as leveraging the power of Github for streamlined
                            collaboration and version control.

                            The project also allows you to view your finalized map in a 3D preview and print your design
                            using a 3D printer as you wish.</p>

                        <p id="pointillist" style="display: none; margin-top: -70px;">This app involves reading any
                            input image file that is in 'gif' format and converting it into
                            a pointillist art format. The program uses random sampling of the image's pixels to generate
                            a set of points, which are then assigned the color of the corresponding pixel. It saves this
                            new file in a folder called ".art_files". Finally, the resulting pointillist art is
                            displayed in a window. . It does this by drawing circles of a fixed size at each point in
                            the file, using the color information from the file. The user can select which file to
                            display from a list of files in the ".art_files" folder. The application of this program is
                            to provide an easy way to convert images into pointillist art and display it to the user.
                            This could be useful for artists or designers who want to explore new visual styles or for
                            educational purposes to teach the concept of pointillism.

                        <p id="recipe" style="display: none; margin-top: -70px;">I developed an Ethiopia Recipe App that
                            promotes awareness of Ethiopian cuisine worldwide. I
                            was inspired to create this app to share the delectable dishes that I grew up with in
                            Ethiopia. My aim is to introduce users to not only the names of these dishes but also how
                            they are made, as many of the ingredients used are common in Western cuisine. The app is
                            secure, requiring login credentials provided in the Read Me on my Github repository. Users
                            can add, edit, and delete recipes and benefit from advanced features such as favoriting,
                            searching, and more. I designed the app as a platform for Ethiopians worldwide to contribute
                            and share their favorite Ethiopian foods.

                        <p id="memory" style="display: none; margin-top: -70px;">I created this Memory Puzzle Game which
                            is a captivating application created using the Python
                            programming language, designed to test and enhance cognitive skills, such as memory and
                            focus, in an entertaining way. It features a user-friendly interface that enables anyone,
                            regardless of their level of experience, to play and enjoy the game.

                            The game employs advanced algorithms to track the location of cards based on their specific
                            label, color, and shape, which are randomly drawn and displayed on a grid. After a few
                            seconds, the player is prompted to recall the color and shape of the label, and the game
                            calls different functions to determine the accuracy of the response.

                            The Memory Puzzle Game offers multiple levels of difficulty, catering to different skill
                            levels and preferences. Its goal is to help players improve their memory and cognitive
                            abilities while having fun.

                            The application is accompanied by detailed documentation that explains the rules and
                            mechanics of the game, as well as any potential challenges or limitations that users may
                            encounter. Overall, this game represents an engaging and thought-provoking experience that
                            is sure to captivate and stimulate players of all ages and backgrounds.</p>

                        <p id="pyth-research" style="display: none; margin-top: -70px;">In 2022, I joined a faculty
                            member on a Python research project that had been ongoing for a
                            few years. My role was to update and debug the system. The project aimed to determine
                            people's preferences for walking or biking in the Rock Island area, their level of physical
                            activity, and to encourage them to walk or bike more. The Python file produced detailed
                            output on which areas people frequently walked or biked versus areas they avoided, based on
                            criteria such as mode and specific reasons for walking or biking.
                            We also considered factors like walking only on sidewalks or both sidewalks and streets.
                            During hand conversations, we mapped the routes on Google Earth, and the Python algorithm
                            generated street blocks and colors for the routes based on ratings for specific blocks. The
                            program created a conversations folder and a compilations folder to show the different
                            outputs.</p>

                            day-to-day words in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia.
                            Amharic is the only language in Ethiopia, and yet it is not widely known or recognized
                            outside
                            of the country.
                            This app aims to promote and spread awareness of this beautiful language to the world. The
                            app
                            features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5, a popular Python library for
                            developing desktop applications.
                            The GUI consists of a main window with several widgets, including a question label, an
                            answer
                            field, a submit button, a feedback label, a progress bar, a correct answer label, and an
                            image
                            label.
                            The app presents six questions, each asking for the Amharic translation of a basic English
                            word
                            or phrase, such as "hello", "bye", "thank you", and "yes".
                            The app provides the correct answers for each question, along with an image depicting the
                            word
                            or phrase in Amharic script.
                            The user enters their answer into the answer field and clicks the submit button to check
                            their
                            answer.
                            The progress bar updates after each question.
                            If the user's answer is correct, the app displays a green "Correct!" message.
                            If the user's answer is incorrect, the app displays a red "Incorrect." message and provides
                            the
                            correct answer along with an image label.
                            The app continues to present questions until all six questions have been answered, at which
                            point the app displays a score message with the number of correct answers and a percentage
                            score.
                            Overall, the Amharic Language Learning App is a simple yet effective tool for introducing
                            users
                            to the basics of Amharic, and for promoting the beauty and richness of this unique

                            correct
                            answers.
                            The app also displays the total number of questions and the number of questions answered
                            correctly.

                            We also studied further how AI is used to create cyber attacks and how AI is used in cyber

                            Studio, an
                            interactive technology, as a tool for teaching human anatomy to students. In the paper, we
                            discussed the multimedia and multi-sensory capabilities of Kinect and how it can provide
                            fun,
                            stimulating interactions that foster learning and increase student motivation. We
                            compared the effectiveness of Kinect Studio to Azure Kinect SDK in terms of accuracy and
                            range.
                            We then conducted experiments to measure the accuracy of depth data and body mass index
                            obtained from
                            Kinect Studio and compared it to actual measurements taken with a tape measure and a LiDAR
                            Camera. We conclude that Kinect Studio can be effective in measuring depth data and can be
                            used
                            to create virtual simulations of human anatomy for teaching purposes. </p>

                            and trust in light of the growing usage of software and systems to track employee activity.
                            I argue that although employee monitoring presents privacy issues, it can have
                            positive effects on productivity and security if done so while adhering to rigorous moral
